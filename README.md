## Brief

> The Kasa site was coded more than 10 years ago in ASP.NET with significant legacy code. Laura, the CTO, therefore launched a total overhaul to move to a full stack in JavaScript with NodeJS on the back-end side, and React on the front-end side. Kasa also took the opportunity to order new models from its usual designer, who is freelancing. A big project for this year!

> Objective: Start the React project and develop the whole application, the React components, the React Router routes, following the Figma models (responsive!) and all the info I give you below. And this with a quality code!
